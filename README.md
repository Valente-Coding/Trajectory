# Trajectory

## Overview
**Trajectory** is a simple simulation project that demonstrates the physics of a projectile's motion. In this 2D simulation, users can control a cannon, adjust its direction, and fire projectiles affected by gravity. This project was created as an experiment to simulate projectile motion and does not have a specific target audience.

## Features
- Move a cannon in a 2D plane using arrow keys.
- Aim the cannon by pointing the mouse cursor.
- Fire projectiles with adjustable force using the mouse and scroll wheel.
- Gravity dynamically affects the trajectory of the projectile.
- Pause the projectile mid-flight using the spacebar.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- The **Processing** software is required to run this project. Download it from [Processing.org](https://processing.org/download/).

### Installation Instructions
1. Download and install the **Processing** software.
2. Download this repository and extract it into a folder.
3. Ensure the folder containing the extracted project is named `Trajectory`.
4. Open the file `Trajectory.pde` with the Processing software.
5. Click the **Play** button in Processing to start the simulation.

## Usage
### Controls
- **Mouse Position**: Adjust the direction to fire.
- **Mouse Button**: Fire the projectile.
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the cannon.
- **Scroll Wheel**: Adjust the firing force.
- **Spacebar**: Freeze the projectile mid-flight.

### Example Use Case
This project serves as a hands-on demonstration of basic projectile physics, useful for educational purposes or experimentation with trajectory motion.
